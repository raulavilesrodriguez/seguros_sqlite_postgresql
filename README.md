#  CAPSTONE - Ideal Insurances Web APP - FINAL PROJECT 

## DISTINCTIVENESS AND COMPLEXITY
- This is a web application focused on the health insurance industry. Specifically for health insurance agents.This web app allows the creation, update and deletion of contacts, allows you to convert a contact into a customer, updates customer information and also allows its deletion. It has an algorithm for calculating the annual profit depending on the number of clients, the contracted plan or plans, payment made by the plan or plans and the age of the client. The profit is displayed in the section called Dashboard. The profit represents like a bank account for the health insurance agent. Profit will increase if the health insurance agent converts a contact into a customer and will decrease if the insurance agent removes a customer.
- This application is more complex than the projects in the Web CS50 course, because it is a Web App that manages several states simultaneously, allowing several elements of the DOM to be updated at the same time. For this, Redux was implemented. This web application allows you to automatically change the DOM and update the backend database without reloading the page, dynamically. Also, this web application is a SPA (single page application) which makes the user experience pleasant. An algorithm was also implemented to calculate the accumulated profit of the user or insurance agent from the sales made. This profit is based on the client's age, the amount of coverage and the deductible of the contracted plan. In other words, it is an application that uses both mathematics for the implementation of the algorithm and the technologies learned in the CS50 Web course, which are Django, JavaScript and React.

## PROJECT STRUCTURE
Ideal Insurances Web APP is an app built in Django (including FOUR models: User, PlanSeguro, Contact, Customer) on the back-end and JavaScript using React - Redux libraries on the front-end. Next, a tree of the project structure is presented:

### Back end
For the Back end in this Web application, Django combined with Django Rest Framework (DRF) was used, achieving a powerful and robust RESTful APIâ€™s. Using django-rest-framework (DRF), class serializers are implemented that will automatically serialize fields in JSON and return to Python objects when needed. The Django REST Framework enables complex data, such as query sets and model instances, to be converted to native Python data types that can then be easily represented in JSON.

- In the back end, 4 models were implemented. Below is an extract of the code of a model.

```python
    class Customer(models.Model):
    contacto = models.ForeignKey(Contact, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='info_contact')
    planes = models.ManyToManyField(PlanSeguro, blank=True, related_name='customers')
    timecustomer = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    payment = models.FloatField(max_length=10, blank= True, null=True)
    age = models.IntegerField(max_length=3, blank=True, null=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"contacto:{self.contacto.name} - payment:{self.payment}"
```
- To create a database from the designed models, you have to navigate to the main directory of the project and execute the command:
```sh
    python manage.py makemigrations capstone
```
Then run the following command to apply migrations to the database:
```sh
    python manage.py migrate
```
In the serializers file serializers.py (./capstone/serializers.py), six serializer classes are created for the different models. Serializers allow you to transform client instances and QuerySets to and from JSON. Below is an extract of the code of a serializer class:

```python
    class GetCustomerSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    contacto = serializers.CharField(source='contacto.name')
    planes = PlanSeguroSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)
    class Meta:
        model = Customer
        fields = ['id', 'contacto', 'planes', 'timecustomer', 'payment', 'age']
```
Eleven methods were implemented in the views.py. The methods handle operations like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, on the root endpoints of our API. Below is an extract of the code of a method:

```python
    @api_view(['GET'])
    @permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])
    def customer(request, contact_id):
        if request.method == 'GET':
            try:
                contact = Contact.objects.get(id = contact_id)
                customer = Customer.objects.get(contacto = contact_id)
                plans = customer.planes.all()
                serializerplans = PlanSeguroSerializer(plans, context={'request': request}, many= True)
                information = []
                information.append({'name':contact.name, 'phone':contact.phone, 'email':contact.email})
                serializer = GetCustomerSerializer(customer, context={'request': request})
                return Response({'customer':serializer.data, 'information': information, 'plans':serializerplans.data})
            except Contact.DoesNotExist:
                return JsonResponse({"error": "Contact not exist."}, status=404)
            except Customer.DoesNotExist:
                return JsonResponse({"error": "Customer not exist."}, status=404)
```

### Front end 
- React + Redux.-
React Redux was used for the front end. Additionally, Redux toolkit is used to manage the status on the front end of this web App. The use of React and Redux toolkit allows this web app to be an application that behaves consistently and with a dynamic experience for the end user.
It is important to indicate that Action and Reducers are combined in redux toolkit as Slice. Sixteen slices are created to connect to the endpoints using fetch, which were created in django.
CreateSlice is used which handles the action and the reducer in one function. After that the reducer is added in the redux store.
Once a structure for redux and store was created, the components for the application were designed.

CombineReducers that combines all reducers into one root reducer that the store uses (./slices/index.js). An extract of the code is presented:

```javascript
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
    login: loginReducer,
    user: userRedurcer,
    signup: signupReducer,
    new_contact: newcontactReducer,
    contacts: contactsReducer,
    ......
})
```
Redux Store:
```javascript
    const store = configureStore({reducer:rootReducer})
    ReactDOM.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <Provider store={store}>
        <App />
        <Toaster />
        </Provider>
    </React.StrictMode>,
    document.getElementById('root')
    );
```

- React Router.-
This Web App is a SPA (single page application), and clicking on any internal page from the website does not need to load a completely new resource. The react-router-dom library is used to achieve routing in this Web App. Routing is the way that web applications direct traffic.

```javascript
    import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route, Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';
    ....
    function App() {
    return (
        <div className="App">
        <Router>
            <Layout>
            <Switch>
                <Route exact path='/login' component={Login}/>
                <Route exact path='/signup' component={Signup}/>
                <PrivateRoute exact path='/' component={HomePage}/>
                <PrivateRoute exact path='/add_contact' component={AddContact} />
                <PrivateRoute exact path='/contact' component={ContactProfile}/>
                <PrivateRoute exact path='/plans' component={PlansPage}/>
                <PrivateRoute exact path='/dashboard' component={Dashboard}/>
                <Redirect to='/login' />
            </Switch>
            </Layout>
        </Router>
        </div>
    );
    }
```

## EXPLAINING THE PROJECT
This application for health insurance agents has the following functionalities:

### Register and Login
- It allows the registration of new users (entering the username, email and password information). For this web app a user is a health insurance agent.
- Once registered, the user or health insurance agent will enter the web app using their username and password.

| Register | Login |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="screenshots/signup.gif" width="400">  | <img src="screenshots/login.gif" width="400">|

For authentication to more of the code in models.py, views.py, urls.py, serializers.py, admin.py in the app called capstone on the back-end it is necessary to add the following configuration to settings.py

```python
    # Specifies localhost port 3000 where the React
    # server will be running is safe to receive requests from.
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [    
    'http://localhost:3000',
    'http://192.168.1.61:3000'
    ]

    # Django All Auth config. Add all of this.
    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'

    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (    
        "django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend",    
        "allauth.account.auth_backends.AuthenticationBackend",
    )
    SITE_ID = 1 
    ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED = True
    ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED = True
    ACCOUNT_SESSION_REMEMBER = True
    ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD = 'username'
    ACCOUNT_UNIQUE_EMAIL = True
    # Rest Framework config. Add all of this.
    REST_FRAMEWORK = {    
    'DATETIME_FORMAT': '%d %b %Y, %I:%M %p', 
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [        
        'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',
    ],
    }
```
For user registration and login the following packages were used:
 - django-rest-auth
 - django-allauth
 - django-cors-headers
 - django-rest-framework

In the front end to have private routes, the following code was created located in the helpers folder, in the PrivateRoute.js file, and whose component is imported into App.js to be used in the routes that you want to be accessed only if the user has been authenticated.

```javascript
    export const PrivateRoute = ({ component: Component, ...rest }) => (
    <Route
        {...rest}
        render={(props) =>
        (localStorage.getItem('token')) ? (
            <Component {...props} />
        ) : (
            <Redirect
            to={{ pathname: '/login', state: { from: props.location } }}
            />
        )
        }
    />
    );
```

### Dynamically Contact Registration
- This web app allows the user or insurance agent to register contacts dynamically, without having to reload the entire page. In other words, this APP allows you to automatically change the DOM and update the back end database without reloading the page.
- Registered contacts are displayed in a table that dynamically indicates whether the contact is a customer or not a customer.
- The contact table allows pagination and search of contacts on the front end.
- Additionally, it allows you to view the accumulated contacts over time in the graph called Contacts over Time. In javascript it is graphed using the recharts library.

| Contact Registration | Search - Pagination |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="screenshots/contacts.gif" width="400">  | <img src="screenshots/search.gif" width="400">|

To update the information without reloading the page we use the hooks useEffect and useState (ModalNewContact.js):

```javascript
    const OnSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        const data = {
            name: contact, 
            phone: phone, 
            email: email, 
            creador: pk,
            token: token
        };
        setLoad(true);
        dispatch(new_contact(data));
        setContact('');
        setPhone('');
        setEmail('');
        props.onHide();
    };

    useEffect(() => {
        if (load) {
            dispatch(get_contacts({pk, token}));
            dispatch(graphcontacts({pk}));
            setLoad(false);
        }
    }, [dispatch, load, pk, token]);
```
### Transform from Contact to Customer
- Once a contact is registered, this application allows you to convert the contact into a health insurance customer, in the event that the business of selling health insurance has been finalized. To do this, the user of this app or insurance agent clicks on the name of the contact, loading their profile page. The insurance agent on the profile page can create a client with the information about the contracted plan or plans, the monthly payment and the client's age. Additionally on the profile page the insurance agent can update the contact information, delete the contact, update the customer information or delete a customer. Everything stated is done with React automatically changing the DOM and updating the Back end database without having to reload the page. 

| Create a Customer | Edit a Customer |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="screenshots/customer.gif" width="400">  | <img src="screenshots/customerEdit.gif" width="400">|

In this application to send an action in redux, useDispatch provided by react-redux is used. The redux state is accessed in the component using hooks, useSelector.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
        if(contact_id) {
            dispatch(getcustomer({contact_id, token}));
        }
    }, [dispatch, contact_id, token]);

    const {successCustomer, errorsCustomer, customer} = useSelector(getcustomerSelector);
```

Additionally, in the profile page of each contact - customer, it was graphed with the following code using the recharts library.

```javascript
    <BarChart
        width={300}
        height={300}
        data={customer.planes}
        margin={{
            top: 5,
            right: 30,
            left: 20,
            bottom: 15
            }}
    >
        <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3" />
        <XAxis dataKey="plan" />
        <YAxis />
        <Tooltip />
        <Legend wrapperStyle={{top: 280, left: 25}}/>
        <Bar dataKey="coverage" fill="#700B97" />                                    
    </BarChart>
```
| Charts on the profile page |

### Profit calculation
To calculate the profit of each client who has contracted at least one plan in the back-end (python - django) an algorithm was developed, which allowed us to relate a rate of the health insurance industry with the age of a client , the amount of coverage and the deductible of the contracted plan. The code is the following:

```python
    serializer = GetCustomerSerializer(customers, context={'request': request}, many= True)
    sorted_q = sorted(serializer.data, key=lambda fecha: datetime.strptime(fecha['timecustomer'], '%d %b %Y, %I:%M %p'))
    # Go through each client
    for x in sorted_q:
        profit = []
        rate = [
            {'age':20, 'rate':1.21}, 
            {'age':30, 'rate':1.27}, 
            {'age':40, 'rate':1.46},
            {'age':50, 'rate':2.41},
            {'age':60, 'rate':4.72}
            ]
        #I want to choose the first key value that is greater than a value that I am comparing
        res = list(filter(lambda edad:edad['age']<=x['age'], rate))
        print(res[-1]['rate'])
        # Go through each plan of each client
        for y in x['planes']:
            value = (y['coverage']/1000)*res[-1]['rate']*0.1 + y['deducible']/100
            profit.append(value)
        x['profit'] = sum(profit)   
    return Response({'customers':sorted_q})
```
In the Dashboard page of the Front - end the information of the profit over time and that of the consolidated profit is shown to the user or insurance agent. Additionally, a table of the clients that generate the profit, the plans that are more profitable and the efficiency between registered contacts and the clients generated by the insurance agent is shown on the Dashboard page. It is important to note that the information for the different plans is loaded from the Django database.

| Dashboard | Plans |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="screenshots/dashboard.gif" width="400">  | <img src="screenshots/plans.gif" width="400">|

Additionally, through a modal, indicators such as the average age of the clients, the average of payments and the average of the coverage contracted are shown. The code for these indicators is as follows:

```javascript
    const {customers, loadingCustomers, successCustomers, errorsCustomers} = useSelector(customersSelector);

    var total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < customers.length; i++) {
        total += customers[i].profit;
    };
    total = total.toFixed(2);

    var age = 0;
    for(let i=0; i<customers.length; i++) {
        age += customers[i].age;
    };
    age = (age/customers.length).toFixed(1);

    var payment = 0;
    for(let i=0; i<customers.length; i++) {
        payment += customers[i].payment;
    };
    payment = (payment/customers.length).toFixed(2);
    
    var coverage = 0;
    var longuitud = 0;
    var coverageAverage = 0;
    for(let i=0; i<customers.length; i++) {
        for(let j=0; j<customers[i].planes.length; j++) {
            coverage += customers[i].planes[j].coverage;
        };
        longuitud += customers[i].planes.length;
    };
    coverageAverage = (coverage/longuitud).toFixed(0);
    var today = new Date().toLocaleDateString();
```

## Style and Design
- Bootstrap was used for styling in conjunction with vanilla CSS (index.css). Additionally to create the effect of opaque texture of a sheet of paper, the library called material-ui was used.
- For the design, several components were created for the Footer, Sidebar, Navbar, which were imported into another component called Layout. These React components made it possible to divide the user interface into separate, reusable pieces.
```javascript
    <Fragment>
            <Navegador 
                setshowSidebar={setshowSidebar}
            />
            <Sidebar showSidebar={showSidebar} setshowSidebar={setshowSidebar}/>
            <main className="main">{children}</main>
            <Pie />
    </Fragment>
```
